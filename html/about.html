    </center>
    <br>

<p>The idea for this project came from discussions between Ian Strait and Dr. Melissa Strait about the high cost of remote sensing units that were mass produced.</p>
<p>Ian came up with the idea of using microcontrollers to collect the data and report it to a server at Alma College.  Over the next few years, Ian Strait and 
Christopher Zolinsky, Information Technology Support for the Dow Digital Science Center,  slowly built prototypes using <a href="https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/">
Vernier Sensors</a> and <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-yun">Arduino Yun mocrocontrollers</a>.  
Larry Elliot, Assistant Director of Enterprise Information Systems for Alma College, built and maintains the server side componants of the system.
With much help from Vernier and the internet in general, we were able to put a couple of prototypes out.  Dr. Melissa Strait helps us with the scientific side of the project and 
comes up with new innovative ways of using the technology.  Dr. David Clark is the faculty member that overseees the project.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this, Ian Strait is looking into feasability of using Raspberry Pi minicomputers with the Arduino Mega Microcontrollers to improve the abilities of the units.</p>

Future Plans
<ul>
  <li>Make the units energy independant using batterys and solar power.</li>
  <li>Add the capability of users to use any of the compatable Vernier sensors to collect data.</li>
  <li>Create a robust on device site that will allow local users to get more information in different ways.</li>
  <li>Create a "Physics box" that has GPS and can collect the data from above and other data like direction, acceleration, altitude, location, etc.  This box will need to be indpendently powered and will collet data to SD card.</li>
</ul>
